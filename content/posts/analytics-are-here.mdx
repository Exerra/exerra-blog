Anyway, stupid titles aside. I caved to the analytics. I brought analytics here and I'm not ashamed!

You may be thinking I implemented a fingerprinter that accurately figures out who you are and stuff, but no it is a very privacy oriented and simple analytic thingy. I quite literally just use the slug (aka that thing that in the URI comes after "/posts/") and the platform (website, email, twitter, discord). Thats it. No, literally, thats it.
