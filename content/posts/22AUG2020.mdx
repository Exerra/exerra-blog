## ```alert('Hello World!')``` 👋
This is the first blog entry, I plan to make more entries about things I've done to my projects!

## Introduction 🙋‍♀️
Heya! I'm a female Musician, Coder, and Designer. As of writing, I know HTML, CSS, JS, and NodeJS computer languages. I know Latvian (main language), English and I am studying German, Japanese and after those, I will study French!

## My plans 📚
* I am looking to further maintain [Karen Bot](https://karen.exerra.xyz)
* I am trying to learn more computer languages, such as Obj-C, and I am thinking of giving Python a spin too.
* Get a MacBook :p

## Things in the way of my plans 🧨
I am a student, I am pursuing professional musical education. That means that I do not have that much free time, and at the end of the school year, I will have a lot of pressure. I am also in an orchestra so on some days I won't even get home by 21:00 (9 pm for you Americans)
