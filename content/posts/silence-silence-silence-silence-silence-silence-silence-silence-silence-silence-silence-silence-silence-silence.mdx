Gotta say, feels weird being back here

Anyway

# Where I went

There's a little app I'm making. Now, I won't spoil it because it is not nearly done (still working on iCloud stuff), but what I can say is that it is sweet, will be 1,99$ and will only be on iOS (possibly on M1 too if it works well there). My goal is to make it be iOS 14 and up, but supporting 14 is quite difficult and if the market share is big enough I may go with iOS 15 and up (it will upset my jailbroken friends, but just don't jailbreak :fr:).

Oh yeah, I have an Apple Developer license because I am not poor unlike Enzo ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž (inside joke don't worry about it)

# Karen Bot

This section focuses on various things that have happened to Karen Bot

## Twitter

Karen has a twitter now! It just informs about status updates for now, but it may do even more in the future :eyes:

## Code updates

Karen Bot has not been receiving that many code updates. I've only commited these thngs to the repo:

1. Changed some outdated images that returned a 404 (now hosted on my CDN)
2. Changed some embed colours
3. Added a self-hosted GitHub runner that along with a GitHub action automatically deploys code

The GitHub runner was a bit interesting to set up, which I had done because I wanted to change hosting from Heroku to my own VPS. First I needed to create a relatively safe environment for Karen Bot to run in; I accomplished it by creating a new user with barely any permissions that can't do anythin crazy. Then, I had to create a script to launch Karen Bot which was super easy to do with GitHub runners and only took me about 20 mins to create and iron out the imperfections. With this new switch of hosting providers I can ensure that Karen Bot has minimal downtime which most likely only will be due to deploying code. Sadly, though, during the whole process Karen Bot was down for which I apologize, From now on Karen Bot will have minimal downtime.

# API

For those who don't know, my API handles mosf of Karen Bot's tasks alongside with some other comparatively insignificant things.

## Switch from IPv4 to IPv6

So
